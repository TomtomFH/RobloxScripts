random collection of scripts i make
to run a script just run
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomtomFH/RobloxScripts/refs/heads/main/main.lua",true))()
```
for some scripts like my Catch And Tame script i have enabled some features per default, if you would like to disable them find their respective script above, copy it and change it however you like.
i might add config saving to my ui in the future but for now it will just stay like this since im working on making the scripts for the games and not the ui.
