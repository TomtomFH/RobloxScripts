# RobloxScripts

A collection of Roblox scripts I build for specific games, with a shared UI library where it makes sense.

## Quick Start

Run the loader in your executor:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomtomFH/RobloxScripts/refs/heads/main/main.lua", true))()
```

## Supported Games

- **Catch And Tame**
	- Place ID: 96645548064314

## Notes

- Some scripts enable features by default (for example, Catch And Tame). If you want different defaults, open the script for that game and change the toggles or values.
- I plan to add config saving to the UI later, but for now I am focused on building the game scripts.
