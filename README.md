# RobloxScripts

A collection of Roblox scripts I build for specific games, with a shared UI library where it makes sense.

## Quick Start

Run the loader in your executor:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomtomFH/RobloxScripts/refs/heads/main/main.lua", true))()
```

## Notes

- All scripts now default to having features disabled. You can enable what you want through the UI, and your settings will be saved automatically.
- The UI library automatically saves your settings (toggle states and input values) per game. Your preferences will load automatically the next time you run the script.
